Break each character down in that ten-character string drwxr-xr-x:
1st char:

d means “directory.” If it were a regular file you’d see - instead.
Next nine chars are three permission triplets (owner, group, others):

### Owner’s perms (rwx):
r = read
w = write
x = execute (or “enter” for dirs)
### Group’s perms (r-x): read & execute, no write
### Others’ perms (r-x): same as group here

# Understanding `drwxr-xr-x` (as shown by `ls -l`)

- The string has 10 characters:
  1. File type (`d` = directory, `-` = regular file, `l` = symlink, …)  
  2. Owner permissions (`rwx`)  
  3. Group permissions (`r-x`)  
  4. Others permissions (`r-x`)

- Each trio (`r`, `w`, `x`) means:
  - r = read  
  - w = write  
  - x = execute (or enter, for directories)

- Example breakdown for `drwxr-xr-x`:
  - `d`  ⇒ directory  
  - `rwx` ⇒ owner can read, write, enter  
  - `r-x` ⇒ group can read, enter  
  - `r-x` ⇒ others can read, enter
