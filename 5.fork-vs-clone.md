Fork vs Clone

Fork (at platform)
 copy an online respo to our account and we have read write access to only our part


Clone（in locall）

all access
# click FORK at github
we need fork because we don't have read write access

Clone to local 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/repo.git
cd repo
```


add upstream
```bash

git remote add upstream https://github.com/original_owner/repo.git
```
create feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```
# push
```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```
