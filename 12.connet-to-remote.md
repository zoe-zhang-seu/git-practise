# already built in local

```bash
git remote add origin xxx.git
# setup up stream
git push -u origin master
```

# ensure is update to date with remote
```bash 
git pull
```

????
```bash
git config pull.rebase false
```

# push to remote at feature branch
```bash
git checkout featureBranch
# set up stream
git push -u origin featureBranch
```

# Rebase
 By rebasing, we change the base of our commits and replay them on top of the new base, allowing Git to perform a fast-forward merge and maintain a linear history.

 ```bash
 # at main branch, commit some changes
 
 #create a rebase branch
 git checkout -b rebaseBranch
git rebase main

git log --graph --oneline
 ```
